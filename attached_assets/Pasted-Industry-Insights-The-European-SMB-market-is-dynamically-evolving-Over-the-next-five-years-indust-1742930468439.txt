About Us

Our journey began with a clear vision: supporting Europe's 31 million businesses—nearly half owned by baby boomers—with smooth, dignified business exits. We recognized a crucial gap: many SMB owners lack succession plans, and their businesses risk disappearing without proper transition strategies.

Having spent over a decade helping SMBs succeed in the digital world—scaling, networking, selling, and growing—we understand entrepreneurs' ambitions deeply. Big M&A institutions frequently overlook SMBs, prioritizing larger deals over genuine impact. This oversight inspired us to create M&A × AI, where digitalization meets real-world business succession.

Our expert team brings diplomacy, extensive networks, strategic insights, and digital transformation expertise to your business transition process. We believe every entrepreneur deserves a rewarding exit and every employee the assurance of continued prosperity.

M&A × AI is here to revolutionize the SMB M&A landscape, empowering entrepreneurs with seamless, stress-free business transitions—one AI-driven valuation at a time.
